cert-issue is a set of code that shows that SSL cannot be started in a docker container running in kubernetes cluster with Windows agent nodes created by acs-engine.

cert-issue-2 is an identical set of code except that the certificate is set through environment variables instead of code.  It fails in exactly the same way.
